		<h4>What does "Full" in Full Stack Mean</h4>
		<p>
			Full means that you develop both the front end, and the back end. 
			The front end is what the user sees on what is called the client computer.
			The back end is what is on the server computer that delivers content to the front end.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>What does "stack" in full stack mean?</h4>
			<p>
				Stack Means that several Programs, a "stack" of programs is used.
				On the front end I use HTML 5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
				On the back end I use PHP, and MySQL.</p>
			<h4>What does 
				<a href="images/staonsping.png">

				</a> mean?</h4>

				L = Linux, which is the basis of our server operating system
				<br>
				A = Apache, which is our web server
				<br>
				M = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySql</a>, the database we use
